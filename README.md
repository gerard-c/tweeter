# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The files outside of the "public" subdirectory were provided by LHL to simulate user data, but all the CSS, HTML and JavaScript controlling the front end was done by yours truly! I don't know what sort of features are present on twitter itself, but tweeter includes a number of neat details, including:

- a collapsing input field for new tweets
- an animated button to control said field
- a fixed navigation bar at the top of the screen
- a fixed "scroll-to-top" button that hides until it is needed
- a character counter that updates as you type
- collapsing error messages for attempts to post empty or overly long tweets
- responsive design for a seamless experience on both mobile devices and desk/laptops
- my love and devotion
